# provia

provia is a skill-based platform where students can prove what they actually know, instead of just listing skills on a resume.

most resumes fail to show real ability. provia focuses on practical proof through small challenges, tasks, and validations that reflect actual skills.

this project is being built as an mvp and is still in progress.

## why provia

- resumes are based on claims, not proof  
- beginners struggle to show real skills  
- recruiters can’t easily verify what a candidate actually knows  

provia tries to fix this by shifting focus from “i know this” to “here is what i built / solved”.

## what provia does (current idea)

- users can select skills they want to prove  
- each skill has small, practical challenges  
- completed challenges act as skill proof  
- skill progress is visible instead of just certificates  

this is meant mainly for students, freshers, and early-stage developers.

## current stage

- planning and product definition  
- setting up frontend and backend structure  
- working towards a basic usable mvp  

## planned features (mvp)

- user authentication  
- skill cards (html/css, javascript, etc.)  
- simple challenges per skill  
- basic progress tracking  

## tech stack (planned)

- frontend: react  
- backend: firebase  
- auth: firebase authentication  
- database: firestore  

this may evolve as the project grows.

## future scope

- peer or mentor validation  
- recruiter-facing skill profiles  
- company-specific challenges  
- public shareable skill pages
