### Resumes list skills. Provia asks you to prove them.

Provia is a proof-based skill verification platform built to help students and freshers turn "claims" into "proof." Instead of bullet points, users submit real work that is vetted by a systematic verification engine.

##  The Verification Engine
Unlike a standard portfolio, Provia implements a logic-based system to validate skills:
- **Automated Check**: Scans for GitHub repository signals and deployment markers (Vercel/Netlify).
- **Ownership Analysis**: Requires user-documented decision-making to prevent copy-pasting.
- **Status Pills**: Clear visual indicators for "Pending" vs "Verified" credentials.

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState/useEffect)
- **Deployment:** Vercel CI/CD
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

##  Roadmap
- [ ] Firebase Integration for persistent data storage
- [ ] Real-time GitHub API integration for repo scanning
- [ ] Peer-review community layer
